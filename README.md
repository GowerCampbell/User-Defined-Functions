# Python User-Defined Functions: Experiments and Applications  
**Author:** Gower Campbell  

This repository documents my experiments with **user-defined functions** in Python, focusing on practical applications like calculating areas, handling codewords, and managing holiday bookings. Each experiment is explained in detail in separate `.md` files, with clear examples and links to the code.

## 1. Introduction  
This repository showcases my exploration of **user-defined functions** in Python. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, making programs modular, organized, and easier to debug. Here, I demonstrate how functions can be used in practical scenarios, such as calculating areas, handling codewords, and managing holiday bookings.

## 2. Experiments with Functions  

### Area Calculator  
- **Description**: A menu-driven program to calculate the area of geometric shapes (square, rectangle, circle) using functions.  
- **Code**: [area_calculator.py](./area_calculator.py)  
- **Explanation**: [area_calculator.md](./area_calculator.md)  
  - Learn how to define functions like `square(length)`, `rectangle(width, height)`, and `circle(radius)`.  
  - Explore a menu-driven interface for user interaction.  

---

### Codeword Handler  
- **Description**: A program that uses a dictionary to map codewords to specific functions.  
- **Code**: [codeword_handler.py](./codeword_handler.py)  
- **Explanation**: [codeword_handler.md](./codeword_handler.md)  
  - Understand how to use dictionaries to call functions dynamically.  
  - Example: `codewords = {"go": handle_go, "ok": handle_ok}`.  

---

### Holiday Booking System  
- **Description**: A travel agency program that uses functions to manage holiday bookings, including flights, hotels, and car rentals.  
- **Code**: [holiday_booking.py](./holiday_booking.py)  
- **Explanation**: [holiday_booking.md](./holiday_booking.md)  
  - Explore functions like `book_holiday()`, `calculate_cost()`, and `display_options()`.  
  - Learn how to handle user input and display booking summaries.  

---

## 3. Key Takeaways  
- **Functions are reusable**: Write once, use multiple times.  
- **Parameters and arguments**: Functions can accept inputs and return outputs.  
- **Modularity**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions.  
- **Practical applications**: Functions are essential for real-world programs like calculators, booking systems, and more.  

---

## 4. Future Plans  
- Explore **lambda functions** for concise, one-line functions.  
- Study **recursion** to solve problems where functions call themselves.  
- Build more complex projects, such as a **budget tracker** or **inventory management system**, using functions.
